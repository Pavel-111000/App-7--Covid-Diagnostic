Brief Description of Goal of Code:
Goal of this code is to provide a diagnostic for determining whether a skin blemish is or is not skin cancer with four quick questions, a results page that calculates perenctenages based on answers, and an image that is resizeable.
 
Known Issues:
Issue includes inserting the resizeable image because the rest of the code is mostly taken from the previous assignment.
